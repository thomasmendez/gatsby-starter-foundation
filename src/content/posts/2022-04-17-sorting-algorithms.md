**Heap Sort**





**Merge Sort**

Description: Divide and Conquer Algorithm 

Time Complexity: 

* Best: O(n * log(n))
* Worse: O(n * log(n))

Space Complexity:

* Best: O(n)
* Worse: O(n)

Pseudocode for Merge Sort:

* Split

  * Function will take in an array
  * If the array contains more than 1 element
  * Split array into two arrays from the middle value
  * Recursively continue calling the same function providing the left and right side of the array (will continue splitting)
* Merge them together

  * Let i, j, k be variables to keep track of left, right, original passed in array respectively
  * Create a while loop that will compare left and right arrays

    * If left is less than right (array will increment, smallest first, largest last. Inverse it by checking if left is smaller greater right)

      * Have original array at index k equal to left at index i
      * Increment i (also k)
    * Else

      * Have original array at index k equal to right at index j
      * Increment j (also k)
  * Create a while loop for left

    * While i is less than the length of the left array
    * Continue to move items to the original array from the left array 
    * Increment i and k  
  * Create a while loop for right

    * While j is less than the length of the right array
    * Continue to move items to the original array from the right array
    * Increment j and k
