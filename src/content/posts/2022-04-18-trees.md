**Binary Tree**

Tree that has at most 2 children as elements 

**Balanced Binary Tree**

Height of left and right subtree differs no more than 1

Pseudocode:

* Create a height function that takes in a root

  * if root is none return 0
  * return the max from the left and right subtree and increase by 1
* Create a isBalanced function

  * get left subtree height and right subtree height
  * the abs of left subtree height minus right subtree height is 1, -1, or 0

```
def height(root):
     
    if root is None:
        return 0
    return max(height(root.left), height(root.right)) + 1
 
def isBalanced(root):
     
    if root is None:
        return True
 
    lh = height(root.left)
    rh = height(root.right)
 
    if (abs(lh - rh) <= 1) and isBalanced(
    root.left) is True and isBalanced( root.right) is True:
        return True
 
    return False
```
